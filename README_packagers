****** At the attention of packagers *******

In the scripts/ folder you will find a Ruby script which will extract all
KLettres svn data from l10n-kde4 in KDE svn, using anonsvn.

The data will be tarred for each language and a tarball
klettres-<iso>.tar.bz2
will be made, where <iso> is the language ISO code used by KDE.

You can use this script for producing additional data for KLettres if you want.
In a custom folder, simply copy the script and run:

ruby klettresl10n.rb

A sub-folder klettres-data/ will be created and the tarballs will be in it.

You only need to be connected to the internet!

Have fun,

Anne-Marie
